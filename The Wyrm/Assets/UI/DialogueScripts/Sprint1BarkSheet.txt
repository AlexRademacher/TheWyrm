Teacher “It is said that to bind a wyrm, 3 sacred relics must be collected and combined. Relics can come in many forms, but traditionally they take the form of artwork.”

Irritated Man “All these darn kids, thinking they can go around doing whatever they want! LEAVE ME ALONE!”

Irritated Woman “You better let me in this very instant! Each minute I'm out here the worse your punishment gets!”

Dubious Man “I thought that dilapidated pottery studio next door was a treasure trove, but it only had one thing worth stealing— err, I mean discovering…”

Old Woman “The potter is always squabbling with the neighbor who lives between us. What business of hers is it what kind of art he collects?”

Potter “I’ve always been put off by that weird painting in my neighbors house. It emanates powerful spiritual energy…”

Cautious Man “I would be careful around that man near the house next door. He seems troublesome.”

Threatening Man “Here’s the deal, you keep walking and I don’t do nothin’. That good for you?”

Worried Woman “That old pottery studio in the south east of the village is a sad sight, isn’t it? I wish this horrible weather would stop, it could be my house next!”

Indignant Art Collector “Everyone is always criticizing me for my taste in art. If you ask me, the guy to the north-west of the school is one with creepy art.”

Aloof Man “That potter across the way has always had an issue with fine art, he can't stand his neighbors paintings.”

Landlord “This place has been abandoned for years ever since that hurricane destroyed the roof. Too bad, it was a nice house too.”

Terrified Man “Don’t go in there, kid! The creature in my home cannot be affected by weapons, only spiritual items!”
